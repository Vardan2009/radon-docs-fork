# Modules

## Introduction to Modules

Modules are a way to organize code in a way that is easy to reuse, test, and debug. Modules are also called packages, libraries, or frameworks. Modules are used to group related code together. For example, a module can be used to group code that is related to a specific task, such as sending an email. Modules are also used to group code that is related to a specific feature, such as a user interface.
